To run in command line:

3. run inupypi_server::

    . <virtualenv_path>/bin/activate

    inupypi_server -c <path_to_config_ini_file>

To run inupypi under apache mod_wsgi:

3. edit and then save the httpd-inupypi.conf.sample into httpd's conf directory and ensure it's being included in httpd.conf

Deploy with Apache
==================

1. Run the inupypi_configure.py script and fill in the values:

    python inupypi_configure.py

2. Copy the file to your apache configuration folder and keep your fingers crossed.

Why another pypiserver application ?
====================================

1. We could not find another pypiserver that supported multiple eggbaskets.

2. We wanted to have templates with our pypiserver so that formatting can be easily done.

3. We had a few ideas where we wanted to bring our pypiserver that were not compatible or accepted by current pypiserver implementations.

TODO
====

1. Create automated processes to generate all of the steps above to make the process less manual


Tests
=====

To run the tests::

    1. python setup.py develop

    2. export export INUPYPI_SETTINGS=<full path to config.ini>

    3. python setup.py test
